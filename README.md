Frontier Elite II Intro Player
---

This is a player for the Frontier Elite II intro, it's a full implementation of the renderer and emulates the
Amiga sound.

The 3d models and music are read from official Frontier exe.  You must already own Frontier or alternatively
send 5 pounds to Frontier Developments to purchase the shareware version.

Why dis?

DooM is ported to pretty much every platform and widely acclaimed with little black
books written on it and everything.  I think Frontier is an equal, if not greater,
achievement in many ways and deserves the same!  I wanted to do a portable version of
at least the renderer - so here it is.
