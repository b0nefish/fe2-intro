Frontier Elite II Intro Player
---

This is a player for the Frontier Elite II intro.  It's a full implementation
of the renderer and emulates the Amiga sound playback.

The 3d models and music are read from official Frontier exe.  You must already
own Frontier or alternatively send 5 pounds to Frontier Developments to
purchase the shareware version.

Frontier Elite II exe must exist in same directory as 'fintro'.  Use the exe
from the CD32 version or the final Elite Club shareware version.  This can be
downloaded from here:

Why do dis?

DooM is ported to pretty much every platform and widely acclaimed with little
black books written on it and everything.  I think Frontier is an equal, if not
greater, achievement in many ways and deserves the same!  I wanted to do a
portable version of at least the renderer - so here it is.
