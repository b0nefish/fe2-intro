Frontier Elite II Intro Player

About
---

This is a RTG player for the Frontier intro, it's a full implementation of the
Frontier Elite II renderer.  The 3d models and music are read from official
Frontier exe.  You must already own Frontier or alternatively send 5 pounds to
Frontier Developments to purchase the shareware version.

Requirements
---

 - Amiga OS 3.x or AROS
 - RTG 640x360x8
 - 68040 or better (real 68040 is too slow)
 - 8MB RAM or more

Tested on FS-UAE / WinUAE and on Vampire V4, reported to work on V1200 by Dr
Procton!

Frontier Elite II exe must exist in same directory as 'fintro'.  Use the exe
from the CD32 version or the final Elite Club shareware version.  This can be
downloaded from here:

  https://www.sharoma.com/frontierverse/files/game/fe2_amiga_cd32.rar

A 640 wide RTG resolution must be available.  The closest RTG resolution of
640 width and 8-bit palette (CLUT) will be used.  640x360 is 16:9 and looks
good.

FAQ
---

Q. Could this be patched into original exe?
A. Yes, it would be work, but the original exe had jump tables for the renderer
   that this code re-implements.

Q. Why?
A. DooM is ported to pretty much every platform and widely acclaimed with little
   black books written on it and everything.  I think Frontier is an equal, if
   not greater, achievement in many ways and deserves the same!  I wanted to do
   a portable version of at least the renderer, and when I heard of the Vampire
   accelerator it seemed an ideal platform to target.
